[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/catdad-experiments/libheif-emscripten/emscripten.yml?branch=master&logo=github)](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/libheif-emscripten/actions/workflows/emscripten.yml)

This repo provides a JavaScript compiled (emscripten) version of [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif). The library is included as a submodule link, and compiled using the original repo scripts without modification to source or build scripts. You can get the compiled version from the [releases](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/libheif-emscripten/releases) page.

If you have found your way here while looking for a `libheif` version that you can install from `npm`, you are in the wrong place. Take a look at [`libheif-js`](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/libheif-js) instead.

Refer to the [original license](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif#license) for licensing information.
