This repo provides a JavaScript compiled (emscripten) version of [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif). The library is included as a submodule link, and compiled using the original repo scripts without modification to source or build scripts. You can get the compiled version from the [releases](https://github.com/catdad-experiments/libheif-emscripten/releases) page.
